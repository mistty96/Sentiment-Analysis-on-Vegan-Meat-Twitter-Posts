# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Vegan-Meat-Twitter-Posts

Question/ Need:
As veganism is more on a rise every year as well as more products being introduced widely to the public, the question on how the public views plant based meat and vegan meat will be investigated. This project will aim to potentially help with marketing strategies for companies interested in releasing products related to the topic of choice.

Data Description:
I will be using the social media platform – Twitter to extract data on the topic of plant based meat and vegan meat. Snscrape will be the library used to scrape information from years 2020-2022(recent) based on the search queries ‘plant based meat’ and ‘vegan meat’ . Each row represents a user’s post related to the keywords, plant based meat and vegan meat over a course of three years. The feature I will be using for analysis will primarily be content to distinguish which words were frequently mentioned throughout all years of 2020-2022.

Tools:
- Pandas
- Matplot lib and Seaborn for visualizations
- NLTK – text processing
- Vader for Sentiment Analysis

MVP:
The MVP for the project will be to look into which words are shown commonly in a user’s post from all three years (2020-2022). I hope to analyze how overall sentiment is reflected across all three years to supplement.
